        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I'm living in The Netherlands with my wife, daugther and black cat (no he doesn't bring bad luck).
            As an emergency dispatcher I've finally found a job that really suits me. Thus came the moment that my phone rang. A random guy 
            found an old Access database I posted in some forum years ago. This was what he was looking for and if I would be so kind and 
            adjust it to his needs. After some thinking I decided to take on this new project and I liked it. Coding (VBA), puzzling, 
            solving problems and improving it more and more. I loved it and really outdone myself in this. And my client? He loved it.
            He loved how I looked at the software with a user point of view, taking in to account the usability of the program. Something he
            missed with others</p>
            <p>Another request came in after a while and I wasn't really looking for one. But it triggered something in me:
            Apparently there still are people who can't find what they need, allthough there is some much to be found already.
            But this new project was to extensive to do in Access. Learning to code standalone software also seemed a hard, long, sometimes
            boring road to take. A few Google searches later I came across Angela Yu's <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">"Web Development Bootcamp"</a> 
            at Udemy. And that was exactly what I was looking for! And thus started my journy in coding and web development.</p>
            <p>This website is one of the projects from the course, but the first one without a solution and without direct support from a "teacher".
            A so called "Capstone Project" to show the skills learned so far. I hope to learn a lot more so I'll be able to make tailor made
            (web)solutions for everyone who needs them. Low key, high quality and really tailored to the user. Programming with a user point
            of view I like to call it.</p>
